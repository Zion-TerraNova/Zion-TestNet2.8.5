# Stránka 7: Security & Compliance

---

## 🔐 Cryptographic Foundations

- Ed25519 signatures, Keccak/Blake2 hashing, AES-256 encryption
- CryptoNote privacy: Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses, RingCT
- Configurable ring size (default 11; paranoid modes up to 101)

```text
Transaction Privacy
────────────────────────────────
• Inputs anonymized via ring signatures
• Outputs hidden via stealth addresses
• Amounts hidden via RingCT commitments
```

---

## 🧱 Binary-Only Distribution & Integrity

- Production builds ship as signed binaries only (no py sources)
- Release artifacts include SHA256 checksums and signature files
- Docker images: Ubuntu 24.04 minimal, non-root runtime, pinned deps

```bash
# Verify release
sha256sum -c checksums.txt  # All files: OK
gpg --verify zion-2.8.5.tar.gz.asc zion-2.8.5.tar.gz
```

Supply chain controls:
- Pinned version locks, reproducible builds (WIP)
- Multi-stage Docker to minimize attack surface
- SBOM generation and image scanning in CI

---

## 🛡️ Node & Network Hardening

- DoS/Spam: mempool limits, fee-per-byte policy, peer score bans
- P2P: limited inbound peers, geo diversity, checkpointed headers
- API: rate limiting, auth on admin endpoints, CORS rules
- Keys: hardware-backed signing preferred, key rotation procedures

```yaml
Mempool Limits:
  max_size_mb: 100
  max_tx_kb: 100
  fee_per_byte_min: 10  # atomic units
Peers:
  inbound_max: 64
  ban_score: 100
  ban_time: 24h
```

---

## 🔍 Audits, Testing, Monitoring

- Third‑party security audit: planned Q2 2026 (code + infra + bridge)
- Penetration testing before MainNet (Q3 2026)
- Continuous fuzzing for tx parsing and P2P protocol
- Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, alerting on anomalies

```text
Audit Scope
• Consensus & Difficulty Adjustment
• Wallet cryptography (key images, RingCT)
• RPC shim & Stratum pool integration
• Bridge validators and multisig rules
• Docker & CI supply chain
```

---

## 👛 Wallet Security

- Recommended: hardware-backed secrets (TPM/YubiKey)
- Encrypted keystores with strong passphrases
- View-only wallets for audit/reporting contexts
- Recovery with seed phrases; offline backups strategy

---

## ⚖️ Compliance Position

- Privacy by default; user sovereignty first
- No KYC in protocol; optional integrations for partners off-chain
- Humanitarian tithe accounted transparently (quarterly reports)
- Jurisdiction-aware: binary distribution and documentation only

---

## 📜 Incident Response & Emergency Procedures

- 72h emergency veto window (Core stewards) for critical exploits
- Public disclosure policy with staged details and hotfix timelines
- Postmortems required; follow-up ZIPs for protocol changes
