# Getting Started

Your first steps on the ZION TestNet.

## What is ZION?

ZION is the first consciousness-based blockchain. It combines conventional cryptography with a humanitarian mission and a novel mining model that multiplies rewards based on spiritual development levels.

### Consciousness Mining

Miners can receive multipliers (1×–15×) according to 9 levels from Physical to ON_THE_STAR. While the mechanism is in active research on the testnet, the intent is to encourage ethical, community-oriented contribution.

## First Steps

1. **Download TestNet Client**  
	Get the latest binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Zion-TerraNova/Zion-TestNet2.8.5/releases).
2. **Run a Node**

	```bash
	./zion-node --testnet --rpc-port 8545
	```

3. **Set Up a Wallet**  
	Create/backup your keys; then connect your miner or interact via RPC. See the [Setup Guide](/docs/setup).

## What's Next?

- Read the [Mining Guide](/docs/mining-guide) and choose an algorithm.
- Check [Live Stats](/dashboard) on the dashboard.
- Explore API in the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference).
